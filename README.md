RIP linear algebra

note: mat_inv.py has some issue, dont use it as of now. Prefer inverse_row_operation.py for some time. I will be updating some
any other person is also welcome to troubleshot and change

DO NOT FORGET TO FORK FIRST

Gauss-Seidel iteration calculator

instructions:

1. Input initial values of x y z seperated by a space
2. Enter precision you want after decimals
3. Enter x in terms of y and z in terms of computer expression
   ex: x=(2y-z)/2
        then enter (2*y-z)/2 as input
4. Enter y in terms of x and z
5. Enter z in terms of x and y
6. Press c for continue iteration and e for exit and press enter

suggestion: please rearrange and find expressions on paper for equation and then input

Inverse by Row Operation(inverse_row_operation.py) Instructions:

1. Input format is well defined when you run the program, use space seperated values whenever asked to do so

In row_echolion.py input is always 3 space seperated integers in context of the prompted text

if you insert a new file or edit an existing one, pls update the input format and precautions if any
:)
